README.txt

This folder contains code that is both functional and well formatted. It contains Python and C++ code.

The C++ code is composed of various Project Euler problem solutions (found at http://projecteuler.net/problems)
while most contain simply a solution and a description of the problem, problems 7 and 13 contain lengthy discussions
of the problem, mostly meant to illustrate how I think and solve problems. Problem 63 is the most difficult problem solved
within.

The hamlettii.py file is my capstone presentation project, it is a short game demo of roughly 1000 lines long, see the
file for more description.

The two files that read Perlin, are simple Perlin Noise generators, simple graphical experiments.
