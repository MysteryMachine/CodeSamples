#### Section 1: Content Description ####

This folder contains several short examples of my programming knowledge and style.

The C++ code is composed of various Project Euler problem solutions (found at http://projecteuler.net/problems)
while most contain simply a solution and a description of the problem, problems 7 and 12 contain lengthy discussions
of the problem, mostly meant to illustrate how I think and solve problems. Problem 63 is the most difficult problem solved
within. The documentation is a bit sparse, as with many of these problems, I tried to come up with a solution as fast as I
could.

The hamlettii.py file is my Capstone project, it is a short game demo of roughly 1000 lines long, written about a year ago
see the file for more description. It is my first attempt at writing Python code.

The two files in Graphics, are simple Perlin Noise generators, simple graphical experiments. There is a Perlin3 found
within the incomplete folder, which has some more advanced 2D implementations. These experiments were done in order to learn
more about procedural generation, which I plan to use in later game programming.
